# SecretPic
A program to draw and encode images.

Draw in strokes of various sizes using magenta, yellow, and cyan. Then click "Encode" and enter a password -- the image will only be viewable when the password is re-entered to "Decode" the image.

Google Chrome is a recommended browser for this program; the program may not work as intended in Safari.
